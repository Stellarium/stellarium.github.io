Stellarium 0.16.0 is a stable version (based on Qt5.6 but it can still be built from sources with Qt5.4) that introduces some new features and closes 38 bug and wishlist reports.

New features include
  - RemoteSync plugin, which allows running several connected instances of Stellarium.
  - Non-spherical models for solar system objects like asteroids and small moons.
  - Solar system config file is now split into two parts.
  - AstroCalc feature extension: What's Up Tonight, graphs, ...
  - DSO: Addition of catalogs of peculiar galaxies
  - New Skycultures: Belarusian, Hawaiian Star Lines
  - Telescope plugin: support for the RTS2 telescope system.
  - Location can now be read from a GPS device.

A huge thanks to the people who helped us a lot by reporting bugs!
