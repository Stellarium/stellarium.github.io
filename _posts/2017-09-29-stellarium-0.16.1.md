Version 0.16.1 is based on Qt 5.6.2, but it can still be built from sources with Qt 5.4.

This version is bugfix release with some important features:
  - Added moons of Saturn, Uranus and Pluto
  - Added improvements for AstroCalc tool
  - DSO catalog was updated to version 3.2:
    - Added support 'The Strasbourg-ESO Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebulae' (Acker+, 1992)
    - Added support 'A catalogue of Galactic supernova remnants' (Green, 2014)
    - Added support 'A Catalog of Rich Clusters of Galaxies' (Abell+, 1989)
  - Added support asterisms and outlines for DSO
  - Added improvements for the GUI

A huge thanks to the people who helped us a lot by reporting bugs!
