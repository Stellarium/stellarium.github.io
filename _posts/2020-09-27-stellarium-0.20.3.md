The major changes of this version:
- Fixed nutation and, with it, season beginning times
- Many changes in AstroCalc tool and core of Stellarium
- Many changes in Oculars and Satellites plugins
- Updated DSO catalog

Important note: We discontinued support an AppImage builds since version 0.20.3 due 
technical problems of AppImage architecture! Please use snap packages instead.

Thank you very much to community for bug reports, feature requests and contributions!
