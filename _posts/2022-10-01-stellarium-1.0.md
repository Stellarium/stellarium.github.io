The Stellarium team did it. Stellarium 1.0 is here!

What makes this 1.0?

- After more than 20 years of development the program is finally accurate enough for historical application.
- This is the first release based on the Qt6 framework, so the project is safe for future development. These packages are tagged with a version number like 1.22.3.
- We keep releasing Qt5-based packages for legacy or obsolete systems. This may include many Windows users who have to run ANGLE mode. These packages are tagged with a version number like 0.22.3.

What is new for users?

- A new, much better skylight model (Not for MacOS and OpenGL ES2 systems, sorry.)
- Many details around eclipses
- Updated Observation List features
- New features in AstroCalc tool
- HiDPI improvements
- Better dithering
- Able to use Windows location service (Windows)
- New skyculture: Samoan
- Updated several skycultures
- Updates in Angle Measure, Satellites, Oculars, Remote Control, Pulsars plugins
- Many more bugfixes.

A huge thanks to the people who helped us a lot by reporting bugs, and especially contributed in development!

Clear Skies!
