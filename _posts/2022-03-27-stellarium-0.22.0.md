- Allow tweaks for the atmosphere brightness/color model and tone mapping
- Several new calendars in the Calendars plugin
- Seasonal polar caps on Mars
- New and improved sky cultures
- Larger textures allowed in Scenery3D
- Improved OnlineQueries and Satellites plugin
- Many fixes in core and plugins.
- Technical preparations towards a major upgrade of the internal Qt framework.
