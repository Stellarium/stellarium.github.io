The Stellarium Team has released version 24.3.

The major changes of this version:
- Performance improvements for computation of Solar system bodies positions
- Improvements in plugins and AstroCalc tools
- Updates in sky cultures
- Updates in GUI

Behind the scenes, many more minor issues were fixed.

TELESCOPE USERS

We have identified some bugs in the TelescopeControl plugin on
the Qt6-based releases.

Telescope users, please try whether this solves your problems.
If not, we are looking for those of you with programming skills to help
us fixing remaining issues. Reward possible!
