The Stellarium Team has released version 23.1.

From now on, releases will have version numbers indicating a
year.release scheme. For Windows, the version of the Qt framework used
is visible as part of the package name. Details are in the User Guide.

PLEASE UPDATE!

This issue mitigates a potential security issue (reported as
CVE-2023-28371), where scripts were allowed to write output text and
screenshots to other places on users' systems apart from the Stellarium
user data directory or configured screenshot directory.

Running unknown scripts (which is a Bad Idea(tm) to begin with) could
have exploited that by attackers (script authors) writing even command
files to vulnerable places. We have not received a report where this
would have caused a problem.

However, now users must explicitly allow such behaviour in the settings
tab of the Script Console.


Apart from that, this release mostly aimed at fixing issues in the 1.*
series, but also brought a few new features:

- Much improved "Solar System observer" and other "Planet observers".
- Solar dates along the ecliptic
- Fixed issues with Observation Lists, and removed need for the extra edit dialog.
- Updated shader code for smoother projection
- Allow texture decimation on the fly for very weak systems like Raspberry Pi 3.
- Solar limb darkening
- Proper shadow edge for satellites

Behind the scenes, many more minor issues were fixed.

TELESCOPE USERS

Like in the 1.* series, it seems the TelescopeControl plugin at least on
Windows works better in the Qt5-based releases. Just install this if you
are affected. We are looking for telescope users with programming skills
to help us fixing this issue. Reward possible!
