Dear translators and users!

Thank you very much for your efforts for make Stellarium available to non-English community!

We incorporated into main package a long awaited feature - support of nomenclature for planetary features. All nomenclature items are translatable and this is a big problem now for translators, because we added over 15000 new lines for translation.

All those lines was extracted in the separate category - stellarium-planetary-features. If you can assist with translation to any of the 140 languages which Stellarium supports, please go to Launchpad Translations and help us out: https://translations.launchpad.net/stellarium

Thank you!
