After 6 years with CVS, 4 years with SVN and 7 years with bzr it is now time for the project to use git, the most popular Version Control System.

We hope that this move will encourage developers to look at our code and give a hand!

You can find it there: [Stellarium on github](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium)
