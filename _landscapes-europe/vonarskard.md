This is the geographical center of Iceland, a barren pass between glaciers. Being sheltered from southern vinds by the huge Vatnaj√∂kull glacier, a great cold mass which then eliminates most humididy from the air, makes the place unusually good for stargazing. Old-style landscape, resolution is a bit low. (File is 1.1 Mb)
