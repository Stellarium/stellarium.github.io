This is a complete high resolution panoramic view of the Alps from Signols (TO, Italy).

Emiliano photographed this panorama in july 2020 by using a Canon EOS 7D, and stitched 
the original 34 pictures together into a spherical panorama using Autopano Giga. The panorama has been 
than cutted into 8 alfa channel pictures and re-dimensioned the width to 1024 pixel.
