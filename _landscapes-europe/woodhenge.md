Woodhenge near Stonehenge was constructed around 2200 BC. It comprised numerous wooden posts set into the chalky ground. These posts of course decayed, and their positions today are marked with concrete cylinders. 

The posts are arranged, in plan view, as a series of concentric egg shapes. The axis of the egg shapes aligns approximately with summer solstice sunrise.
