A new bridge is being built across de bay. The 360° panorama image was taken at noon of September 10th, 2012, from the pier of the small marina just closed to the Cadiz head of the bridge. 

The final picture is the result of stitching 11 frames, taken out of a 63 seconds full HD video, using PhotoStitch and Gimp 2.6.8.
