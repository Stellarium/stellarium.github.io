The original English Garden landscape was re-constructed by Barry Gerdes as an old_style landscape.  This means that it can be used with video hardware which cannot cope with single very large texture files, and yet preserves the resolution of the landscape (by splitting the images into multiple files). Try this is the original English Garden landscapes doesn't load on your computer.
