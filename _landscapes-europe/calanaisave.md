Callanish is arguably the finest megalithic monument in the British Isles, and is just the largest site in a vast complex of interconnected monuments designed to observe the southern major standstills of the moon. From this position at the end of the avenue, the moon is seen to set behind the rocky outcrop of Cnoc-an-Tursa, only to 're-gleam' in the centre of the main circle a short time afterwards. (4MB)
