The Tor with its iconic Tower of St. Michael is one of the most recognisable landmarks in England. 
At the cross-quarter day nearest the Celtic festival of Samhain (early November time) the Sun sets as it passes by the doorway of the tower. 
The famous St. Michael ley-line runs through here. (3.6MB)
