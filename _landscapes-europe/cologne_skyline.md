Panorama taken on 4th of August 2019 at Barbarossaplatz, Cologne, Germany. About 1500 meters 
away from the Cologne Cathedral at 27 meters above the city's elevation level. The panorama 
has been heavily idealized in the editing process: many buildings making up the skyline were 
replaced manually with higher resolution photographs and objects blocking the view were removed 
or reduced. The horizon was carefully isolated and provided with an illumination layer for a 
beautiful silhouette in night view.
