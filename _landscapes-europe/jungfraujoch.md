Lying at 3580m in the Bernese Alps, the Jungfraujoch is often dubbed "Top of Europe". It has been home to an astronomical observation station for more than 80 years. The spherical landscape was created from 20 images taken on June 29th, 2008, at 1015, from the lower terrace of the Sphinx Obervatory. The landscape comes in three resolutions (1024 / 2048 / 4096).
