KAIRA (Kilpisjarvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array) is a project of the Sodankyla Geophysical Observatory. KAIRA is a dual array of omni-directional VHF radio antennas, principally funded by the University of Oulu in Finland. It makes extensive use of the proven LOFAR antenna and digital signal-processing hardware, and can act as either a stand-alone passive receiver, as a receiver for the EISCAT VHF incoherent scatter radar in Tromso, or for use in conjunction with other Fenno-Scandinavian VHF experiments. In additional to being a powerful observing instrument in its own right, KAIRA will act as a pathfinder for technologies to be used in the proposed EISCAT_3D radar system.
