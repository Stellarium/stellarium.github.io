Sighthill stone circle is a modern stone ring constructed in 1979 by amateur astronomer and SF writer Duncan Lunan. 
Located next to the M8 motorway in Glasgow city centre, yet with surprisingly good views, the circle has alignments to the solsticial solar rises and settings and the lunar standstills. 
Alignments to the rising of Rigel are included for 1979 AD and 1800 BC. The circle has a central stone, which is not shown in this landscape. 
As of 2014 the area is scheduled for redevelopment, although the Council have promised that the stone circle will be relocated somehwere in the vicinity of its present location. 
It was still there at winter solstice 2015 when this NEW landscape was created. (13MB)
