Was it an observatory? Yes indeed it was! The alignment of the monument with the summer solstice sunrise has been well known for many years. 
The alignment with the winter solstice sunset may have been more significant. For the first time, many additional alignments are published, 
and are detailed here: <a href="http://www.brontovox.co.uk/">www.brontovox.co.uk</a> These alignments demonstrate that Stonehenge was primarily 
a functional scientific instrument, used for measuring angles. The angles of interest were the rising and setting bearings of the sun, moon, 
and stars. It was therefore possible to map the entire visible sky.
