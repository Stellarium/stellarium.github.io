The Frantoio Rodiano (Rodiano oil press) is situated on the foot of Mount Gargano in Puglia / Italy. Just a few kilometers uphill lies Monte Sant'Angelo, the famous stop for christian pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. Stargazing has been kin to this region for milleniae: the oldest graves found in the Frantoio's vicinity date back to pre-etruscan times, and the famous Castel del Monte, an astronomical observation in itself, is not far either. The spherical landscape was created from 8 images taken on September 20th, 2010, at 1707, from the uppermost terrace of the Frantoio Rodiano. The landscape comes in three resolutions (1024 / 2048 / 4096).
