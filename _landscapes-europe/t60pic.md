Sylvain photographed this panorama in February 2007 and stitched it together into a spherical panorama that can be used with Stellarium. This is the panoramic view from the amateur 60cm telescope dome from <a href="http://astrosurf.com/t60/">T60 Association</a>, installed at Pic du Midi Observatory.
