A demonstration of the lunar analemma - the path of the Moon across the sky during the lunar month on Earth. 
Due to the Earth rotation and the Moon orbital motion; time interval isn't equal 24 hours. 
It can be calculated by using the formula for synodic period: 
1/S = 1/E - 1/M,
where the corresponding periods are the sidereal day on Earth (1/E) and the sidereal lunar month (1/M).
