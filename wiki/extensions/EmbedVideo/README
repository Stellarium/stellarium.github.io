== About ==

The EmbedVideo extension is used to embed flash videos from video hosting
sites such as YouTube.com into a MediaWiki wiki website. It adds parser
functions {{#ev:}} and {{#evp:}} which can be added to pages to embed videos
in the wiki page.

For more information about EmbedVideo, to download, to contribute, and to
report bugs and problems, visit the GitHub project page:

=== History ===

The original version of EmbedVideo was created by Jim R. Wilson. That version
was later forked by Mohammed Derakhshani as the EmbedVideoPlus extension. In
early 2010 Andrew Whitworth took over active maintenance of both extensions
and merged them together as "EmbedVideo".

The newer versions of EmbedVideo are intended to be fully backwards-compatible
with both older EmbedVideo and EmbedVideoPlus extensions.
