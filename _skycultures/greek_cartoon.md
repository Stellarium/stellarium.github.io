Greek myths, and how they made it to the nightsky. a bit funny and totally un-bloody. This overlay uses the same characters and figures as used in my lectures at at the Schriesheim public observatory. Not all myths are not entirely complete and have been interpreted here and the with a certain degree of freedom, since the original editions (Collection from Gustav Schwab a.o.) were not found to be so useful to inspire kids for the nightsky.
