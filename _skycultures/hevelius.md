Constellation images from Johannes Hevelius's famous 17th century Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive Uranographia star atlas.

A mixture of high resolution images from the US Naval Observatory and the Space Telescope Science Institute, and some lower resolution images. All images have been further processed to clean up and provide suitable contrast for Stellarium.
