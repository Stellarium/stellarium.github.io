Euler is the nearby telescope that can be seen in the west. It is operated by the University of Geneva, and its main duty is the quest of extrasolar planets. The New Technology Telescope (NTT) shows up just behind Euler's control room, Tarot is in due south, and finally the venerable ESO 3.6 meter telescope sits on its hill in the southeast. The panorama was taken on September 3, 2010, at about 7:25 local time, a wonderful sunrise after a snowy night. <a href="http://obswww.unige.ch/~tewes/stellarium_landscapes/">Screenshots</a>
