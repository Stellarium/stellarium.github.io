The Very Large Telescope Project (VLT) is a system of four separate optical telescopes (the Antu telescope, the Kueyen telescope, the Melipal telescope, and the Yepun telescope) organized in an array formation. Each telescope has an 8.2 m aperture. The array is complemented by three movable Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) of 1.8 m aperture. The project is organized by the <a href="http://www.eso.org/">ESO</a>.
