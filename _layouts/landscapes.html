    <p>{% include tr.html s="Be aware that many people's video hardware cannot handle very large textures. This is hardware and driver dependent. A typical maximum image size is 2048x2048 or 4096x4096." %}</p>
    <h3>{% include tr.html s="package contents" %}</h3>
    <p>{% include tr.html s="Please package your landscape in a .zip file with all files inside a directory in the .zip file. This should be unique to your landscape, and it would be nice if it was all lower-case with no spaces." %}</p>
    <p>{% include tr.html s="You should also include a readme.txt file which describes the landscape and specifies any usage restrictions or licensing terms for the images used in the landscape." %}</p>
    <h3>{% include tr.html s="licensing" %}</h3>
    <p>{% include tr.html s="Before you distribute images as part of a Stellarium landscape, please ensure you are legally entitled to - you must be the copyright holder for the images, or be able to distribute them for use with Stellarium under the terms of some agreement with the copyright holder (e.g. Creative Commons licensed images found on the web)." %}</p>
    <p>{% include tr.html s="It is important to explicitly state what use may be made of images for your landscape. This should be done in the readme.txt file inside the .zip file." %}</p>

    <h3>{% include tr.html s="file encoding" %}</h3>
    <p>{% include tr.html s="The landscape.ini and readme.txt files should be UTF-8 encoded text or plain ASCII. It's probably a good idea to adopt the Windows line ending encoding, (i.e. CR LF). Both Windows and *nix style line ending encoding should work OK in Stellarium, but Windows users will have an ugly time reading the readme.txt if it uses *nix-style newlines." %}</p>
    <h3>{% include tr.html s="need hosting?" %}</h3>
