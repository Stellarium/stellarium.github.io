<a href="http://www.walkway.org">Walkway Over The Hudson Historic State Park</a> spans the Hudson river in the state of New York between Poughkeepsie and Highland. 
It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poughkeepsie_Bridge">originally a railroad bridge</a>, which was completed in 1889 and was in service until 1974, when it was closed after a fire. 
The bridge is 1.28 miles long, with the center deck 212 feet above the river (which is at sea level &mdash; the river actually flows both directions with the ocean tides far inland beyond Poughkeepsie). 
The bridge was later refurbished into a pedestrian walkway, which opened in 2009, becoming the longest footbridge in the world.
