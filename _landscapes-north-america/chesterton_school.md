This landscape was taken to help encourage students to learn about science and astronomy using Stellarium. 
The panorama was taken at the playground area of Chesterton Elementary School on October 23, 2011. 
The image was constructed using the Multiple Image Method using 8 overlapping images to provide a high level of detail. 
The original composite panorama image was 22442 (width) x 2418 (height) pixels. 
Composite photo reduced to 5 equally sized photos of 2048 by 1024 pixels. 
Many trees created complex horizon background but left details, such as tether-ball poles, in place during transparency development to keep landscape realistic. 
The lines of the playground provide an interesting perspective with Stellarium.
