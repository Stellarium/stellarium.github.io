A view of <a href="http://www.heritageparkmuseum.com">Heritage Park Museum</a>, Terrace, British Columbia, Canada. It was photographed in August, 2011. 

The full panorama, including sky, can be viewed at <a href="http://www.360cities.net/image/heritage-park-museum#0.00,0.00,70.0">360Cities</a>.

This collection of early 20th Century log buildings shows the diverse construction styles used by immigrant settlers of the Skeena Valley. 
The two story Kalum Lake Hotel is the centrepiece of the park. To the right of the hotel a summer student talks with two of the fifteen or so young visitors attending a children's day.
