Pyramid Island dark sky observation site in <a href="http://pc.gc.ca/jasper">Jasper National Park</a>, Alberta, Canada &mdash; world's largest <a href="http://www.jasperdarksky.org/">Dark Sky Preserve</a>. 
This site is only 15 min from the town of Jasper, yet nearly perfectly dark. The panorama was taken just before sunset in October 2011.
