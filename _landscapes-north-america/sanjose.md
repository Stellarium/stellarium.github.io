This panorama was made using Nasa's WorldWind. Screenshots were taken at 45 degree increments. The screenshots were layered and stitched together, and then offset until the the Northern mountains were aligned. A landscape such as this could be made of any location in the world. There is a plug-in for WorldWind called "BigScreenshot," that may make the process easier, but not automate it. A plug-in could be written to do this entire process automatically.
