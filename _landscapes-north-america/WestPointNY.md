<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy">The United States Military Academy at West Point, New York</a>, was established in 1802, at a location originally used by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.  The photos used to assemble this landscape were taken from the parade field at West Point during Branch Week. Visible in front of Washington Hall one can see, among other things, two AH-64 Apache helicopters, two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, a Stryker armored fighting vehicle, and an M-1 Abrams Tank.
