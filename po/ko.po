"That summer I only listened to “Ceremony” and I remember it didn’t rain. I "
"was nineteen years old. It was the summer after my second year at the "
"University of Western Ontario, which would also be my last year at the "
"University of Western Ontario, and I took a job advertised to students. The "
"job was to get in a van and take a yellow pad of sign-up forms and a pen and "
"wear comfortable shoes (no flip-flops) and sell fixed-price natural gas to "
"anyone who could be convinced they were paying too much for broken-price "
"natural gas.\r\n"
"It was a blank summer. Every day seemed of exactly the same quality. On the "
"job, though, some days paid better while other days paid not at all. It felt "
"scammy and demoralizing to work on commission, and one by one all the girls "
"quit. I stayed with the boys.\r\n"
"I had it bad for one of them in particular. I’ll call him Jon. He looked "
"like a hockey player Elisha Cuthbert would date, or maybe like Elisha "
"Cuthbert’s brother, and he had a kind of bruising plum mouth I always love. "
"Once at Jon’s house after work I mixed vodka with purple Kool-Aid—only the "
"powder, no water. I drank it from an oversized wine glass. Then I thought, "
"isn’t there a first time for everything, like smoking a lot of weed with six "
"boys? When I woke up I was in Jon’s roommate’s bed and Jon’s roommate was "
"gone for the summer so it was fine and Jon’s t-shirt, which he had put on me "
"over my dress, was covered in grass stains and purple.\r\n"
"School began without me. Jon’s roommate came back. Some guys he knew were "
"having a party, and he told Jon to bring that girl, the one from the summer. "
"So Jon with that mouth had talked about me—me, to someone I’d never even "
"met.\r\n"
"To my boyfriend I said I was going to a party with my friends and to my "
"friends I said I was going to a party with my boyfriend. To Jon I said: "
"whiskey please, I can’t so much as smell a glass of vodka without seeing "
"purple. I remember he told me vodka doesn’t smell. I remember he mixed "
"whiskey with lemonade to approximate a sour, and it was sweet. After that "
"nothing for a while.\r\n"
"It was an old Victorian house with wooden floors, except at the top, where "
"the ceilings sloped halfway down the wall and the carpets were thick and "
"gray. The walls were also gray. The room was dusty and full of VCRs and it "
"had never seen sunlight or Febreze. Maybe I held my breath too long. "
"Maybe—the stairs were so steep, I thought later—I just ran out of it. Either "
"way, my eyes opened when the door did. I was lying face down in the carpet, "
"my breath hot and awful, and behind me someone was fucking. Jon, I thought. "
"His dick kept moving in a girl who wasn’t and she was me. Then it took "
"forever, but my head sort of turned to see two or three boys at the door and "
"one was holding up his phone. It didn’t stop. These were old like Nokia "
"phones. I wasn’t scared, only—I wanted no one to see me in this light.\r\n"
"What things could I have done. I stopped it please. The boys left not only "
"the room but also the party and maybe I could have called a friend. Or my "
"roommates. I still believed some cops were good. I could not have called my "
"parents, but I could have told my brother to bring the car. Instead I drank "
"water and splashed it on my face and when I came out of the bathroom I said "
"let’s go. Where? To your house. Okay, said Jon. We went to his house and I "
"slept with my back against his chest.\r\n"
"I didn’t cry when I got home, or that night when I did not tell my "
"boyfriend, or the next week when I wondered what I’d wanted. What would I "
"have said had I been asked? Perhaps it would feel worse to have cheated than "
"to have been cheated, and cheated was how I felt, more or less. I did not "
"cry about it for nine years, and not once did I say that I was raped.\r\n"
"Note that I am also not saying it now. Note that bodies have different "
"thresholds for different kinds of pain and so do minds. Note that Jon was "
"deep-down dumb as fuck and that in a strange or self-saving way I felt sorry "
"for him because he couldn’t think long enough to ask. Note that he was still "
"sleeping when I left that morning. Note that there is no way Jon thought of "
"himself as a rapist so, when it comes right down to it, I’d rather freeze in "
"hell than feel like a victim. Is that a joke? I really hope you’re making "
"all these notes, because this isn’t a story you hear every day. That’s a "
"joke.\r\n"
"Last November I went to Philly to interview Professor Camille Paglia, the "
"notoriously tough critic who trades on several contradictions, not least of "
"which is “public intellectual.” We talked in her office for two hours. I "
"have no time for straight white men who quote Paglia to excuse their anti-"
"feminism, but Paglia herself I adore—sometimes all the more when I disagree. "
"Here is the transcript of our conversation concerning her long-held and "
"controversial views on date rape.\r\n"
"Me: Have you ever thought about just rethinking your position?\r\n"
"Paglia: No! My history isn’t your generation, my history is the generation "
"that was suppressed with compulsory virginity in the 1950s, okay. But then "
"we arrived at college, and we had the parental rules in effect, where we "
"women had to sign into the dorm at eleven o’clock at night and the men were "
"free to roam the men’s dorms. Why? “Because you could be raped,” we were "
"told. Okay. “We are acting in loco parentis.” My generation’s the one that "
"said, No! Let us risk rape! Give us freedom! It’s more important than any "
"risk of rape.\r\n"
"Me: Were you having sex with men then?\r\n"
"Paglia: Yeah, I was dating men. Here’s the point. I’m talking about date "
"rape, I’m never talking about stranger rape, okay. I’m talking about date "
"rape. Never someone seizing a woman off the street. I’m talking about when "
"women have a transaction with another person, okay, and stop making "
"decisions about what they’re conveying to that person.\r\n"
"Me: I feel that would be a worse betrayal for many women.\r\n"
"Paglia: No, but nevertheless, what I’m saying is that the modern free woman "
"has to take full responsibility for the part she plays in any social "
"transaction.\r\n"
"Me: I don’t think it’s a woman’s job to provide for every instance in which "
"a man might just, like, unleash his animal nature. It is his job to control "
"himself.\r\n"
"Paglia: What I’m saying is men should have ethics and honor. However, it is "
"realism to say to women, you cannot expect that every man you encounter is "
"going to be an ethical, honorable person. It will still fall on women to "
"make choices that will end up with you not being dead. I don’t mean just "
"being raped, I mean being dead. I don’t want a double standard, where women "
"say well, I want to have the option to go out, to go up to a strange man’s "
"apartment—and I say don’t ever put yourself in a position [in which] you can "
"be overwhelmed and raped. This goes also to getting your purse stolen, or "
"leaving a window open at night.\r\n"
"Me: I don’t think very many women think of getting raped the same way as "
"they do having their purse stolen or their car jacked. Rape is "
"invasive—physically, physiologically invasive. You can’t deny that part of "
"it.\r\n"
"Paglia: Right, exactly. And I don’t want a situation where women are being "
"stupid. I don’t want the fetishization of women’s sexuality. I don’t want "
"women saying our sexuality is special. I don’t want middle-class women "
"saying we want an endless extension of the safety of the bourgeois living "
"rooms to the world. And I call this “street smart feminism.” I’m saying "
"you’ve gotta be street smart, okay, and don’t put yourself in any position "
"you can’t get out of, all right?\r\n"
"Me: Do you have sisters?\r\n"
"Paglia: I have a younger sister—listen, I don’t want a situation where a "
"woman is being stupid, okay, and being naive. I’m sick of this. No woman "
"should be going home from a bar with a man she met at that bar that night. "
"Women wanna play that game, because it’s exciting, but it’s a risk. I’m "
"saying to women, grow up and become the equal of men. What you say is, I "
"gambled and I lost.\r\n"
"Six months earlier, I had spent nearly a week in San Francisco, and for the "
"first few days I was alone in my friend’s apartment while she was away for "
"work. I decided to meet a man I knew from the email newsletters he sends out "
"daily—I think; I no longer subscribe—as part of the literary website he "
"runs.\r\n"
"After we’d hung out twice, he invited me to a poker game at “the office.” I "
"said I don’t play poker. He said I didn’t have to. Because so many women and "
"queers and queer women I admire have written for this website, it did not "
"occur to me that when I arrived, I would be faced with a room full of dudes. "
"All the dudes were older than I was; most of them were wearing flannel "
"shirts. It looked like an anxiety dream. After twenty minutes, I left.\r\n"
"The next day this man sent a newsletter that very ethically and honorably "
"listed all of his friends by their names. I was listed as “a girl.” As in: "
"“A girl came by for a while. She had a new tattoo and stylish clothes and "
"just wanted to watch. I asked if she would count out the chips and some of "
"the guys got flustered when she was around and there was a lot of fighting "
"after she left. What is it about pretty girls?”\r\n"
"If you want men to think you’re pretty (and I do) they will often stop "
"thinking there. If you are the only girl in a room full of men, you are "
"always only “the girl.” These are rules. That night there was an exception: "
"“Isaac insisted,” said the email, “she was a woman. Then he refused to talk "
"about it.”\r\n"
"Isaac is his real name and he is a real mensch. Concerning the rest of them, "
"at twenty-six I felt much the same way as, at nineteen going on twenty, I "
"had taught myself to feel about Jon. Had anyone been thoughtful enough to "
"ask me what it was that I wanted, I would not have said, “Actually, I’m "
"pretty happy just watching you move stacks of plastic around a table while "
"you offer unsolicited opinions on the various facts of my life.” I did not "
"leave soon enough. But only one time since (and it felt almost as dulling) "
"have I been the only girl in the company of more than two dudes. I have "
"reorganized my life so as not to waste it too easily; I have reconstituted "
"risk as waste.\r\n"
"I do not believe women have to grow up in order to become the equals of men. "
"I believe we’re born their equals, and while I second Paglia’s imperative to "
"“grow up,” my impetus to do so is different. For me the goal is to stop "
"needing men (plural) for validation, for protection, for comfort. For sex? "
"But I have spent the decade in love with individual men, one or sometimes "
"two at a time, and I cannot imagine what it would be like to not need a man "
"to fuck.\r\n"
"It took me long enough—from the end of my virginity to my first single "
"summer at twenty-one—to learn the trick of sleeping with someone without "
"waking up obsessed (and even then, it didn’t exactly become my superpower). "
"It was easy to stop believing that “sex is between a husband and wife,” as "
"my parents had taught me; it was less easy to stop believing that “sex is "
"between two people who love each other very much,” as my friends’ parents "
"had taught them. Even the girls I knew who never went to church would sleep "
"with boys they did not like, then feel cheated when the boys did not text "
"back.\r\n"
"When I went home with Jon that night it was because I wanted him to prove "
"that his crime had not been violent, but passionate. Or because I felt as "
"entitled to comfort from his body as he felt to victory from mine. I was not "
"stupid and naive because I drank too much too fast or because I trusted my "
"friend to mix a drink or because I assumed he would check to see whether my "
"eyes were open before undressing me. No, I was stupid and naive because I "
"expected a carefree white boy who did not know what he had done to suddenly "
"come around and fix it.\r\n"
"Daisy Coleman was fourteen and a high-school freshman in Maryville, "
"Missouri, when—according to the account she wrote for xoJane in "
"October—Matthew Barnett, then seventeen, invited her to his house, got her "
"blackout drunk, raped her, drove her home, and left her passed out in the "
"January freeze. “Within five hours,” Maryville Sheriff Darren White told the "
"Kansas City Star, “we had all the suspects in custody and audio/video "
"confessions.” Two months later, the charges disappeared, and shortly after "
"that the Coleman home, now empty and for sale, burned down. More than a year "
"passed before Daisy’s story became national news.\r\n"
"When my littlest sister started drinking, then went to college, I began "
"answering each of her “emergency” calls—and there are lots; her moods are "
"like mine—with steely teeth. I always think “pregnancy,” but first I think "
"“rape.” Or I think about how if she could not say it, I would say it for "
"her. But it is true for both my sister and me, that if we are raped, we can "
"tell someone, because the odds are someone will believe it. Girls like us "
"and like Daisy are the luckiest. We profit indirectly from injustices to "
"those who are not white, not middle-class, not traditionally pretty or "
"conventionally smart. (A related truth: Although it is statistically "
"possible, I have never felt afraid that a black man on the street will rape "
"me. Between him and me, it’s me the cops would believe, me who would be seen "
"on television, and me who can tell the story the majority wants to hear. The "
"real threat is from white guys in nice clothes who can get close enough to "
"whisper without anyone around us looking twice.)\r\n"
"Still the odds are not enough. Daisy’s smiling, cheerleading innocence makes "
"her the kind of victim the national news can not just tolerate but also "
"celebrate, and yet this innocence does nothing to prevent girls like her "
"from being raped, nor to ease the shaming that ensues, and this innocence "
"does not mean their rapists feel guilty.\r\n"
"This series of events is too terrible for me to comprehend, and yet there is "
"something familiar in the case, and in the Steubenville case, and in the "
"Rehtaeh Parsons case (to name the year’s most-read-about three). In all "
"three there were cell phones on the scene of the rape, and there were boys "
"holding the cell phones, and so there was evidence, and there was more than "
"one boy to blame but it was the girl who got called all the names.\r\n"
"In two of the cases she stood alone for a long time in a small place until a "
"national audience came and sought revenge. In Rehtaeh’s case, she had "
"already died. The North American family can bear national outrage easier "
"than local outrage. We can think: “Those boys.” We cannot think: “Our "
"boys.”\r\n"
"In all three cases the evidence was first presented, as a joke, to a jury of "
"the rapist’s peers.\r\n"
"That night I did not want to find out, or maybe I already knew, whom they "
"would choose if I made them. Jon or me. My word against his. Their phones. I "
"can see him that morning after I left, when he no longer had to pretend to "
"be asleep, calling Rob or Jake, saying it’s cool, man. She’s cool. Don’t "
"show anyone those pictures. I used to think I was lucky to be nineteen and "
"not fourteen when it happened because that meant my body was stronger. My "
"mind, too. Now I think it’s because I was old enough to know what not to "
"do.\r\n"
"Many bourgeois living-room feminists—from Susan Brownmiller to Jill "
"Filipovic—believe that all rape is about power and not about sex. "
"Contrarians, like Paglia, argue back that it is a primitive sexual act. Rape "
"may be a sexual act, but much of consensual sex, too, is about power, and in "
"any case I am not interested in what motivates a rapist. I am interested in "
"what permits him.\r\n"
"One answer to this is “rape culture,” a term that, as the journalist Denise "
"Balkissoon has pointed out, seems to cover everything from insensitive "
"comments to the cover-up of rapes in the U.S. military to the sale of child "
"brides in Afghanistan. But no matter how many Americans are murdered every "
"year, and no matter how many times we say we “could just kill that guy,” we "
"don’t talk of “murder culture.” We talk of “gun culture.” Accordingly, when "
"we talk about rape, we should rage not against “rape culture” but against "
"“dick culture.”\r\n"
"When I say “dick culture,” I mean: The inordinate pride men feel in owning "
"and wielding their dicks. The idiotic contests they hold to see whose dick "
"is more powerful, can shoot off harder, go farther. The way both men and "
"women will say “he was thinking with his dick.” The spasmodic reaction of a "
"dick-bearing man when one suggests that, given the yearly number of dick-"
"related injuries per capita, the use of his dick should be restricted. Every "
"man with a dick believes he is a responsible dick-owner. Dicks don’t kill "
"people, he says. You can’t take away our dicks. Yet there are always so many "
"“accidents!” I am no handmaiden to the nanny state, but you have to admit: a "
"ban on dicks seems like the most pragmatic solution.\r\n"
"Yes, I am tired of rape stories. I think rape stories are boring. I am sick "
"of rape stories on CNN and sicker of rape stories on Jezebel. I would like "
"instead to see national, televised debates and full episodes of morning "
"radio shows and several long-form podcasts and a portion of the next State "
"of the Union address dedicated to determining whether men should be allowed "
"to keep their dicks.\r\n"
"Guns, however, should be given to girls at age ten.\r\n"
"For nine years I did not write this story because it did not feel important. "
"During many of those years, I wrote about so many trivial things that the "
"omission was really a feat. I alluded to it, once. Barely. I believed that "
"since the source of self-worth is somewhere above our genitals, rape is not "
"often the worst thing that can happen to a girl or a woman (or a boy or a "
"man, but you know). It is only the most obvious. It is a theft of power with "
"the minimum of effort, which is force. And because I could not recall the "
"moment of losing control—because in my memory, and probably in fact, there "
"were no signs of struggle—it was easy to not feel that loss. It was also "
"expedient, and it did not prevent me from empathizing with other girls who "
"had the same thing happen, but it hurt them more, either when it happened or "
"later. I also felt that even if I had been raped, I remained lucky to not be "
"raped worse.\r\n"
"Virginie Despentes, the French punk-cum-feminist writer, was raped by three "
"white guys, when she was seventeen, while hitchhiking with her friend "
"outside Paris. After she published her revenge-fantasy novel, Baise-moi "
"(1994), she kept meeting women who told her “I was raped, at this age, in "
"these circumstances,” and in King Kong Theory (2006), she asked: “[H]ow "
"shall we explain the fact that you hardly ever hear the other side of the "
"story, ‘I raped so and so, on this day, in these circumstances?’” Just as "
"women have done for centuries, men tend to “euphemize” the event: “They may "
"have ‘pushed her a little,’ or ‘fucked up a bit[.]’” Rape is for rapists; as "
"for men, “What they do is always something else.”\r\n"
"I started writing this essay one night after I read a thing on Gawker that "
"some cool guys I know thought was funny. The thing was: A woman had mistaken "
"a hamburger for her sandal while getting out of a Dodge pickup truck in "
"which she’d been seen having sex outside a Waffle House in Loganville, "
"Georgia. Sure, except—the woman had stepped on the hamburger after being "
"told several times by the cops to get dressed, and she had to be told all "
"those times because she “simply sat in the passenger’s seat,” not "
"responding. The man, meanwhile, “immediately put his pants on.”\r\n"
"According to the police report, the man blew a .154 on the breathalyzer; the "
"woman blew a .216. So on Twitter I said two things: First, does anybody "
"think maybe this woman was raped? And second, the Gawker post seems like a "
"joke at the expense of the lower class. The author of the post responded not "
"to my first, larger concern (rape) but to my second, lesser point (class "
"prejudice), because if there is anything I know about dicks it is that they "
"are always happier winning a completely insignificant argument than merely "
"participating in a serious one. He ignored the maybe-it-was-rape plot to "
"focus on why I thought the man and woman in the story were “lower class” "
"when he had certainly not said so. He had just reported a cool anecdote.\r\n"
"I don’t know why it was this one exchange that started me crying. It could "
"have been any number of cool anecdotes, on any number of websites, on any "
"number of nights. It is cumulative and then all of a sudden: the feeling "
"that for every rape joke there is an even worse joke in which nobody even "
"sees rape.\r\n"
"Note that I am not saying the woman in Georgia was raped, or even that she "
"was unconscious. Note that I do not know who she is or what it means for "
"her, for you, or for my sister to be sober enough. I only know what I do not "
"wish to see. Watching a scene with drunk, naked bodies, in which one of the "
"bodies is female, women like me feel sick with rape while men who read the "
"same things we do, men of the same milieus, men who really like us, are only "
"looking at their cell phones and laughing.\r\n"
"Several days after I had stopped reading about Daisy Coleman, I was talking "
"about her to a man who is as far from being a dick as a man can get. I asked "
"if he had ever been one of the boys in a story like that. Was I surprised "
"when he said yes. I’m still naive.\r\n"
"He said it did not get so bad. They were all fifteen or sixteen and they "
"were drinking in one of those basements that is its own house. The kid whose "
"house it was had rich parents and a shaved head and a sort of mute cruelness "
"about him. There were two girls, three or four boys. One of the girls got "
"too drunk. He described how she was pretty but I can’t. He described how she "
"came to while the rich kid had a hand down her pants and the rich kid had "
