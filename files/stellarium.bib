 abstractNote={For centuries, the rich nocturnal environment of the
                  starry sky could be modelled only by analogue tools
                  such as paper planispheres, atlases, globes and
                  numerical tables. The immersive sky simulator of the
                  twentieth century, the optomechanical planetarium,
                  provided new ways for representing and teaching
                  about the sky, but the high construction and running
                  costs meant that they have not become
                  common. However, in recent decades, ``desktop
                  planetarium programs'' running on personal computers
                  have gained wide attention. Modern incarnations are
                  immensely versatile tools, mostly targeted towards
                  the community of amateur astronomers and for
                  knowledge transfer in transdisciplinary
                  research. Cultural astronomers also value the
                  possibilities they give of simulating the skies of
                  past times or other cultures. With this paper, we
                  provide an extended presentation of the open-source
                  project Stellarium, which in the last few years has
                  been enriched with capabilities for cultural
                  astronomy research not found in similar, commercial
                  alternatives.},
